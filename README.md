    <p>A Transformative Approach to Autism and ID Support</p>
</div>


<br />

In India, an estimated 2.2 million children are living with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Intellectual Disabilities (ID). Many of these children face significant challenges in communication, social interaction, and emotional regulation. They often struggle with tasks that may seem simple to others—making eye contact, expressing their emotions, or participating in everyday activities. The lack of structured support for these children leads to feelings of isolation and frustration, both for them and their families.

Our solution, Sahayk, is designed to address these very challenges by providing a comprehensive and immersive learning platform. Using advanced technologies like VR, AR, and AI-powered AAC tools, Sahayk offers a safe space for children to learn and practice essential life skills. From customizable AI avatars that simulate social interactions to real-time feedback for speech development, our platform empowers children to break communication barriers and build confidence. Through guided AR-based therapy sessions, emotional regulation exercises, and interactive games, Sahayk promotes holistic development.

Every child deserves to be understood and supported. Every parent deserves to see their child thrive. Sahayk is not just a tool—it’s a helping hand, a guiding light, and a hope for families who want the best for their children. Join us in making a difference, and be a part of a journey that brings smiles, words, and a world of new possibilities to every child’s life.
